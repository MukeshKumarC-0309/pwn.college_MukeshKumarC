# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the 'echo' and 'hello' commands with multiple arguments to obtain different results.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Ifu1Z_KD_MkX0ECHgisy1-iOMaX.0VN0EzNxwCO1gjNzEzW}' 

We use the 'tab' key in the terminal.'Tab' command can also be to autocomplete commands.Here itâ€™s given that the hidden command starts with pwncollege and we must use the tab key to autocomplete it.We see that the hdiden command is 'pwncollege-28682' which gives us the output flag.   
'''  
Connected!                                                                             
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-28682       
Correct! Here is your flag:      
pwn.college{Ifu1Z_KD_MkX0ECHgisy1-iOMaX.0VN0EzNxwCO1gjNzEzW}      
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$      
'''   

## What I learnt
I learnt that we can use the 'tab' key to autocomplete commands also saving us time even in that aspect.
