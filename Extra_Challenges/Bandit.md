# Bandit Game
This game uncovers what i learnt in linux so far and this document holds my journey through this game...      

First,we are asked to connect the ssh key to connect the terminal and the game.The username and password are both bandit0 for the zeroth level.Hence we create a connection using 'ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220' with 2220 being the port number.Once connected it asks for the password,which is bandit0.Once connected,the game begins.To move to level 1,we have to find the password hidden in the challenge.So,first we use the 'ls' to scout for files,in our case there is one singular file called 'readme'.Hence we read that file using the 'cat' command and it shows us the password for the next level,in this case 'ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If'.Then we exit from the exisiting ssh key and start a new one.Hence we create a new ssh key for the new level with the username changing to bandit1.Hence it's 'ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220' and enter the given password to move to the next level succesfully.In the next level,it says the password for the next level is hidden in a file named '-' in the homedirectory.Hence we use 'cat ./-' to open a file as using 'cat -' won't work as it excepts a prompt.This gives us the password for the next challenge ie.'263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx'.Hence we repeat the same process of exiting the ssh key and re-entering the new ssh key to access the next level.In the next level,it says the next password is hidden in a file named "--spaces in this filename".Hence we use cat 'cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"' because we can’t use the name as it is as it consists of spaces and hyphens which can be interpreted wrongly.Once done,we unlock the password to the next level which is "MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx".Hence we exit from this ssh key and create a new ssh key for the next level.For the next level,it says that the password is hidden in a hidden file in the 'inhere' directory.Hence we switch to that directory using the 'cd' command.Then we use the 'ls -a' command to view the hidden files.There we find one name '...Hiding-From-You' which is the file we need to read.Hence we use 'cat' to read the file to get the password for the next level.For the next level,it is given that the password is stored in the only human-readable file in the directory.Hence we switch to that directory and use the 'file' command to check what kind of files are there.As we search the entire directory,we find a singular file which we can read ie './-file07'.Hence we use the cat command to read the file which gives us the password for the next level ie.'4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw'.Hence we exit this ssh shell and create a new one for the next level.In the next level,the password is hidden in a file that's not executable,is 1033 bytes long and is human readable.So,we switch to the 'inhere' directory and use the command 'find . -size 1033c' to filter out the files that have a size of 1033 bytes long.Hence we find the file and read it by catting it out giving us the next password ie.'HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG'.Hence we exit this ssh key and start the one for the next challenege.In the next level,we have to find a file which is owned by the user 'bandit7' and the group 'bandit6' and is 33 bytes long.Hence we use the arguments as said for the 'find' function and we get a bunch of files which satisfy the criteria.One among them is '/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password' which is the file that holds our password.Hence we read the file by catting them out in this case our password is 'morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj'.Hence we exit this ssh shell and start a new one for the next challlenge.In the next challenge,the password is hidden in the 'data.txt' and is next to the word 'millionth'.Hence,we use the grep command to filter out the password.We get the password after using 'cat data.txt | grep millionth' which is 'dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc'.Hence we quit this ssh shell and start a new one for the next challenge.Here,it says that the password is hidden in the file 'data,.txt' and occurs only once.Hence we can use the 'sort' and 'uniq -u' command to find out the line of code which has only occured once.We pipe them to connect all 3 commands ie.'cat data.txt | sort | uniq-u' which succesfully gives the password which is '4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM'.Hence we exit this ssh shell and move on to the next one.In the next level,it is mentioned that the password is in the file 'data.txt' but preceded by too many '=''s.So we use the 'strings' operation to pick the strings out of the file and use the grep command for '='.Hence we use 'strings data.txt | grep ='.to get the password ie.'FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey'.Hence we exit the ssh shell and start the next one for the next challenge.In the next level,it’s given that the password is hidden in the file 'data.txt' but contains base64 encoded data,hence to decode it we use 'base64 --decode' to do it paired with the 'cat data.txt' which gave us the password ie.'dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr'.Hence we exit the ssh shell and start the new one for the next challenge.In the next challenge,it mentions that password is in the file 'data.txt' but it was been case-switched and rotated 13 times.Hence 'tr' command comes to use here which is used to translate characters.Here we use 'tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M' to convert the text into the passcode that is,'7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4'.Hence we exit the ssh shell and start a new one for the next challenge.
