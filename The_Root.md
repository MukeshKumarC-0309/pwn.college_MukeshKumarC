# The Root
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the path '\pwn' to obtain our result!

## My Solve  
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{EvHvRrsXCgAbRUp5uLOT2_VJ8qb.QX4cTO0wCO1gjNzEzW}'  

First we invoke the file path '\pwn' to access said directory.Doing so automatically gives us our flag.  

'''  
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn      
BOOM!!!     
Here is your flag:    
pwn.college{EvHvRrsXCgAbRUp5uLOT2_VJ8qb.QX4cTO0wCO1gjNzEzW}      
hacker@paths~the-root:~$     
'''

## What I learnt
I learnt that we can access different files across different locations by mentioning the file path in which the file is stored using the '\' command.

## References
None.
