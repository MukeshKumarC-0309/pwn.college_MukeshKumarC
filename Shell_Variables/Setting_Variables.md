# Setting Variables
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and create a variable to get the desired output.   

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{MHHL0GAQFX-nCREMsi58PDRclHZ.QX5UTN0wCO1gjNzEzW}'     

Here,we are asked to create a variable and store a value in the terminal.We can do that by simply specfiying the variable name and equate it to the value,in this case 'PWN=COLLEGE' but we need to remember that variables are case-sensitive.Hence on running 'PWN=COLLEGE' we successfully complete the challenge and get the flag output.   
'''    
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE    
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:    
pwn.college{MHHL0GAQFX-nCREMsi58PDRclHZ.QX5UTN0wCO1gjNzEzW}    
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$
