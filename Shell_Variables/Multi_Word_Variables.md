# Multi Word Variables
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and create a variable to get the desired output.   

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{M1V5NCgV8b3hoXjEvyCyKVb0_0c.QXwYTN0wCO1gjNzEzW}'     

Here,we are asked to create a mutli word variable and store a value in the terminal.We can do that by simply specfiying the variable name and equate it to the value,in this case 'PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"' but we need to remember that variables are case-sensitive and have to be given under " ".Hence on running 'PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"' we successfully complete the challenge and get the flag output.
