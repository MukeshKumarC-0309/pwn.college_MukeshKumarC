# Changing File Ownership
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the 'chown' command to get the desired output.     

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{cZJaHCHxpMU55Z7ePgXm4cKRRFp.QXxEjN0wCO1gjNzEzW}'      

Here,itâ€™s given that we need to change the access of the '/flag' to hacker.For this we need to use the 'chown' command which is used to change ownership of a file.So here,we use 'chown hacker /flag' to change the ownership of the flag.After that we can run the '/flag' as hacker to get the output.    
'''    
Connected!                                                                              
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag        
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag      
pwn.college{cZJaHCHxpMU55Z7ePgXm4cKRRFp.QXxEjN0wCO1gjNzEzW}         
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$         
'''
