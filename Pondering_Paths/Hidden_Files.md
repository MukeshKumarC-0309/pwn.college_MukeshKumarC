# Hidden Files 
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the 'ls' command along with -a prompt to get the desired output.  

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{4XxWaV3TDsXyaJ02OGYshYcLVKt.QXwUDO0wCO1gjNzEzW}'  

Here,we try to access the 'flag' file from the '/' directory.But we find no such file.So we use the 'ls -a' command to see all files.'ls -a' command is used to see all the files in the directory,even the hidden ones.There,we find the 'flag' file hidden in the directory.Then we use the 'cat' command to read the file,thereby getting our flag.

## What I learnt
I learnt the use of the '-a' prompt along with the 'ls' command to view all the files,even the ones which are hidden which is very useful if we have to search for files that arenâ€™t visible in the directories.
