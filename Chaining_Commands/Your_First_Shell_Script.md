# Your first shell script
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the 'bash' command to get the desired output.     

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Y1qiHaXB_g_Q5WxLqJzvu_3ZCkx.QXxcDO0wCO1gjNzEzW}'     

Here,we use the 'bash' command in the terminal.The 'bash' command is used to access the shell scripts,which are files that contain a list of commands to be executed in a '.sh' file.Here,we are asked to run '/challenge/pwn' and '/challenge/college' simultaneously in a shell script x.sh.Hence we can open a text editor,type the commands and save with a '.sh' extension.Then we use 'bash x.sh' to access that file and get the flag output successfully.

Connected!                                                                            
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh        
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:    
pwn.college{Y1qiHaXB_g_Q5WxLqJzvu_3ZCkx.QXxcDO0wCO1gjNzEzW}    
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$

## What I Learnt
I learnt the use of 'bash' command which is used to access shell scripts which can run a lot of commands at once since itâ€™s in a file.
