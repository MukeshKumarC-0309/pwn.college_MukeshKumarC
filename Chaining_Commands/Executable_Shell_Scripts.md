# Executable Shell Scripts
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke the implicit use of 'bash' command to get the desired output.     

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{EzDPNm6Sg8XLr090shnd-6SNQXF.QX0cjM1wCO1gjNzEzW}'     

Here,we are asked to run a script shell without calling the 'bash' command.This is possible if itâ€™s an executable file and all we have to do is to mention the absolute/relative file path to execute a shell script.Here,we are asked to run '/challenge/solve' through a script shell and then run it without invoking the 'bash' command.Hence after the creation of the shell script using a text editor,we use 'ls -l' command to check for permissions.Since no user has permission to execeute the file,we use 'chmod a+x' to make it executable and then succesfully run the script shell to get the flag output.

## What I Learnt
I learnt that we can execute shells scripts directly from the terminal without using the 'bash' command if the file is an executable file.
