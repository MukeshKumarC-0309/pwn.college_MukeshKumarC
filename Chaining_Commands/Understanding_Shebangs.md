# Understanding Shebangs
The challenge asks you to open the terminal in the pwn.college DOJO and invoke shebangs to obtain desired results.

Here,we use shebangs to define a file's interpretation.Sometimes linux will be forced to run scripts that arenâ€™t bash's but from python or some other language.During such situations we use shebangs,a phrase of different symbols/characters that lets linux know what kind of file it is interpreting,in this case #!/bin/bash for bash scripts.Hence,we are asked to create a shebang for bash script and print the term "hack the planet" which is done using the 'echo' command in a file editor.Once done,we check for its permissions using 'ls -l' command.We see that no users have execute permissions.Since hacker is the user we can use 'chmod u+x' give execute permissions to the user.After that,we run '/challenge/run' which checks for all conditions and once satisfied,provides the flag value.

Testing your script...    
Perfect! Your flag:

## What I Learnt
I learnt the use of shebangs which are phrase of symbols/characters that define what kind of file linux has to run so that it can be interpreted correctly.
